🍽️ Restaurant Rating Prediction
Welcome to my Restaurant Rating Prediction project!
In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict restaurant ratings based on various restaurant features, helping food lovers and business owners better understand key success factors.

📚 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the "Aggregate Rating" of restaurants using machine learning techniques.
I cleaned, explored, engineered features, trained multiple models, and evaluated their performances to create a robust predictive system.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies
Python 🐍

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-learn for machine learning modeling

Jupyter Notebook for development environment

📊 Dataset Information
The dataset contains features like:

Name

Location

Cuisines

Average Cost for Two

Price Range

Online Delivery Status

Table Booking Status

Number of Votes

Aggregate Rating (Target)

⚙️ Process Flow
Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Dropped irrelevant or highly sparse columns

Transformed categorical columns (e.g., 'Yes/No' to 1/0)

Feature Engineering

Created new features such as:

Affordable & High Rated

Engagement Metrics (based on Votes)

Popularity Metrics (based on Online Delivery & Table Booking)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identified key factors influencing restaurant ratings

Detected outliers and handled them appropriately

Model Building

Used:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Compared models based on R² score

Evaluation

Training vs Test R² scores

Model interpretability

Insights and feature importance analysis

Deployment Ready (Optional step)

Prepared the model pipeline for potential deployment

🧠 Key Insights
Table booking and online delivery services are associated with higher ratings.

Votes (user engagement) strongly correlate with restaurant success.

Restaurants offering multiple cuisines generally attract higher ratings.

Price Range plays a major role; affordable restaurants can still achieve top ratings if other factors are right.

📈 Results
Best model achieved high R² scores on both training and test sets without overfitting.

Successfully predicted restaurant ratings based on customer engagement and restaurant features.

🚀 Future Work
Deploy the model with a simple UI using Streamlit or Flask.

Include real-time restaurant data for live predictions.
